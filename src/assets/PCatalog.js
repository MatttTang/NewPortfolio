        Title: "Word Guessing Game",
        Description: "This is a web application I created that tests users' knowledge of words from the Merriam Webster Dictionary. The game presents the user up to 3 definitions of a word, and the user guesses the word. High scores are kept with the system for users to display their knowledge.",
        Exp: "With this project, I wanted to learn the basics of Reactjs. While creating the project, I was also interested in tying in some of my knowledge from Amazon Web Services, so I have a DynamoDB table linked to the project to keep scores. This project really got me interested in Front End development, and although it is far from perfect, this project will always be special to me.",

    "Previous Website":{
        Title: "Portfolio Website",
        Description: "This is my old portfolio website, and my first attempt at learning HTML. With this project, I wanted a place where I could document my progress in computer science. While incredibly infuriating, the project was very fun. I worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and in particular some jQuery. Originally I had this hosted through Google Cloud, but I moved it to Amazon Web Serivce through static web hosting.",
        Exp: "I created this project in a time when I was not sure I wanted to pursue computer science. In creating this project, I stayed up countless nights trying to adjust view heights, and move text around, but for all that tedious work I had a lot of fun. So much fun, that often I did not realize how late into the night I would work.",

    "Community Algorithm": {
        Title: "Matching Algorithm",
        Team: true,
        Author: "Matthew Tang and Jun Won Song",
        Description: "Within a theoretical community, multiple study groups are made each week, hosted at different houses. To be fair, everyone has to be in a group with everyone else at least once, and each person must host every other person atleast once. In addition to these constraints, some individuals within the community are married, and so they are inseperable when attending study groups. For this project, I was the main developer in charge of physically writing the code, and deciding what data structures we should use, and our different functions, and artifacts we should implement, whilst my partner dealt a lot with the write-up and documentation. We both contributed heavily to the construction of our algorithm.",
        Exp: "We were tasked with creating an algorithm, that given the number of people allowed per study group and a list of people, would determine how quickly each person could host everyone else. The project was done in Java using IntelliJ. In doing this project, I learned how complex algorithms can be, and how much thought goes into creating an elaborate way to solve problems. This project could not be done with just coding, as a team we also worked on countless sheets of paper constructing diagrams and graphs. More information and our documentation can be found in our GitHub below.",
